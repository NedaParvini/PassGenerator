In the first step I wrote a function including different criteria for password.
I defined each variable based by type of them in different categories.
I also defined an empty one to put the final result in it
I wrote a code for While loop to make sure that each password should have an specific lenght and it should be between 8 to 128 characters and if the users enter a password out of this range they get a warning message that shows how to choose the proper range
I also wrote some if codes to check for each variable category. Each if clause defines if they want to choose between categories it add to final password string and put it in that string
I also define a variable to shows how to generate the text of a password.
